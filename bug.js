```javascript
// ... your Tailwind CSS classes
<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded shadow">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Uncommon Error</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700">This is some text that should be styled with Tailwind.</p>
</div>
```

The error is that the text does not get styled correctly, even though the classes seem correct. 

The actual error might be a missing or incorrect configuration in the Tailwind CSS setup, or a conflict with another CSS framework.
